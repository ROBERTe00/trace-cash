## üéØ Achievement Codes Reference

These achievement codes are used in the `useGamificationTriggers` hook:

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `first_expense` | First Transaction | Added your first expense/income |
| `first_investment` | First Investment | Added your first investment |
| `10_transactions` | 10 Transactions | Tracked 10 transactions |
| `50_transactions` | 50 Transactions | Tracked 50 transactions |
| `100_transactions` | 100 Transactions | Tracked 100 transactions |
| `5_investments` | 5 Investments | Added 5 investments |
| `diversified_portfolio` | Diversified Portfolio | Added 10+ investments |
| `portfolio_1k` | Portfolio 1K | Portfolio value reached $1,000 |
| `portfolio_10k` | Portfolio 10K | Portfolio value reached $10,000 |
| `portfolio_100k` | Portfolio 100K | Portfolio value reached $100,000 |
| `goal_setter` | Goal Setter | Created a financial goal |
| `onboarding_complete` | Onboarding Complete | Completed app onboarding |

**Note**: These achievement codes must exist in the `achievements` database table for the unlocking to work properly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes for Testing

### 1. Database Setup Required
Before testing gamification features, ensure the `achievements` table has entries with the codes listed above. If achievements don't exist in the database, the unlock attempts will silently fail.

### 2. Gamification Initialization
- The gamification system initializes when the Layout component mounts
- Auto-triggers run whenever expenses/investments arrays change
- Achievement checks happen via useEffect hooks

### 3. Points System
- Level up occurs every 100 points (Level 1: 0-99, Level 2: 100-199, etc.)
- Points are cumulative and never decrease
- Level up triggers a special toast notification

### 4. Testing Edge Cases
- Test with no data (empty states)
- Test with exactly 1 expense (first achievement)
- Test rapidly adding multiple items (debouncing)
- Test page refresh (state persistence)

### 5. Mobile Testing Critical
- Test on real iOS devices (safe area insets)
- Test on Android devices (notch/camera cutouts)
- Test bottom navigation overlap
- Test landscape orientation

## üöÄ Next Steps for QA

1. **Execute Test Plan**
   - Follow `tests/test-plan.md` systematically
   - Record pass/fail status for each test case
   - Document any issues found

2. **Database Verification**
   - Ensure all achievement codes exist in DB
   - Verify RLS policies allow reading achievements
   - Check user_levels and user_achievements tables

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Verify all 10 previously fixed problems still work
   - Pay special attention to onboarding flow
   - Test dashboard with various data scenarios

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Monitor gamification trigger performance
   - Check for any lag when adding expenses/investments
   - Verify no memory leaks from useEffect hooks

5. **Cross-Device Testing**
   - Test on minimum 2 iOS devices
   - Test on minimum 2 Android devices
   - Test on tablet (iPad or Android)
   - Test on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Achievement Database Dependency**

   - No automatic seeding of achievements

2. **Achievement Uniqueness**
   - System checks for existing achievements before unlocking
   - Multiple triggers won't create duplicates

3. **Points Persistence**
   - Points stored in database, not local storage
   - Requires authentication to track points
