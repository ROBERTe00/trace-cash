# 🔐 Plaid Integration Setup Guide

**Status:** ✅ Code Ready, ⏳ Awaiting Credentials  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** October 20, 2025

---

## 📋 Overview

The Plaid integration is **fully implemented** and ready to use. Currently running in **Demo Mode** because Plaid API credentials are not configured. This guide explains how to activate real bank connections.

---

## 🎯 Current State

### What's Working (Demo Mode):
- ✅ UI components fully functional
- ✅ Mock card connections
- ✅ Mock transaction syncing
- ✅ User interface complete
- ✅ Database schema ready
- ✅ Edge Functions created

### What Needs Setup:
- ⏳ Plaid API credentials (Client ID + Secret)
- ⏳ Supabase environment variables
- ⏳ Edge Functions deployment

---

## 🔧 How to Activate Real Plaid Integration

### Step 1: Get Plaid Credentials

1. **Sign up for Plaid:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup
   - Create a free account (Sandbox mode)

2. **Get your credentials:**
   - After signup, go to API keys
   - Copy your `client_id`
   - Copy your `sandbox` secret
   - (Later: get `development` or `production` secret for live)

### Step 2: Configure Supabase

1. **Go to your Supabase project:**
   - Open https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Add environment variables:**
   - Go to Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
   - Add:
     ```
     PLAID_CLIENT_ID = your_client_id_here
     PLAID_SECRET = your_sandbox_secret_here
     PLAID_ENV = sandbox
     ```

### Step 3: Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Login to Supabase CLI
supabase login

# Deploy the Plaid Edge Functions
supabase functions deploy plaid-create-link-token
supabase functions deploy plaid-exchange-token

# Verify deployment
supabase functions list
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Apply the Plaid schema migration
supabase db push

# Or manually run:
psql -d your_database < supabase/migrations/20250120_plaid_complete_schema.sql
```

### Step 5: Activate Real Component

In `src/pages/CreditCardIntegration.tsx`, uncomment the real component:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Demo Mode):
<PlaidDemo />
{/* <PlaidLinkComponent /> */}

// AFTER (Real Mode):
{/* <PlaidDemo /> */}
<PlaidLinkComponent />
```

## 🧪 Testing in Sandbox Mode

### Test Banks (Plaid Sandbox):
```
Bank: Chase
Username: user_good
Password: pass_good

Bank: Bank of America  
Username: user_good
Password: pass_good
```

### Expected Flow:
1. Click "Connect Card"
2. Plaid Link modal opens
3. Select bank → Enter credentials
4. Success → Accounts appear
5. Click "Sync" → Transactions fetch
6. Transactions auto-categorized and saved

---

## 📊 Plaid Integration Features

### OAuth Flow:
- ✅ Secure bank authentication
- ✅ Token exchange (public → access)
- ✅ Encrypted storage in Supabase

### Account Management:
- ✅ List connected accounts
- ✅ View balances
- ✅ Manual sync button
- ✅ Disconnect functionality

### Transaction Syncing:
- ✅ Fetch transactions from Plaid
- ✅ Auto-categorize with AI logic
- ✅ Store in expenses table
- ✅ Link to plaid_transaction_id

### Data Mapping:
```
Plaid Transaction → Expense
├── transaction_id → plaid_transaction_id
├── amount → amount (absolute)
├── name/merchant_name → description
├── date → date
├── category[0] → category (mapped)
└── account_id → plaid_account_id
```

---

## 🔐 Security Features

### Implemented:
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 flow
- ✅ Access tokens encrypted in database
- ✅ Row-level security (RLS) on all tables
- ✅ Read-only access to bank data
- ✅ Secure Edge Functions with CORS

### Recommended (Future):
- [ ] Implement Supabase Vault for token encryption
- [ ] Add webhook signature verification
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic
- [ ] Add rate limiting on Edge Functions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Plaid Link not opening":

- Check: Edge Function deployed successfully
- Check: Browser console for errors

### "Token exchange failed":
- Verify: PLAID_SECRET is correct
- Check: Supabase Edge Function logs
- Ensure: User is authenticated

### "Transactions not syncing":
- Verify: plaid_items table has access_token
- Check: Edge Function has correct permissions
- Test: Call sync manually from browser console
