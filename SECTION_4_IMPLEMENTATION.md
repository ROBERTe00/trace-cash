## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### **Option 1: Command Line (Recommended)**

```bash
# Run all tests once
npx vitest run

# Run tests in watch mode (auto-rerun on changes)
npx vitest

# Run tests with UI (visual interface)
npx vitest --ui

# Run tests with coverage report
npx vitest run --coverage

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run tests/pdf-upload.spec.ts
```

### **Option 2: Add to package.json** (Manual)

Since `package.json` is read-only in Lovable, you can manually add these scripts locally:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest",
    "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
    "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage"
  }
}
```

Then run: `npm run test`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running?
1. Make sure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Check Node version: `node -v` (should be 18+)
3. Verify Vitest is installed: `npx vitest --version`

### Mock Errors?
1. Check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` is set in `tests/setup.ts`
2. Verify mock Supabase client in test files
3. Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Coverage Not Generating?
1. Install coverage provider: `npm install -D @vitest/coverage-v8`
2. Run with coverage flag: `npx vitest run --coverage`
3. Check `coverage/` directory for HTML report

### CI/CD Workflow Not Running?
1. Ensure `.github/workflows/test.yml` is committed
2. Check GitHub Actions tab in repository
3. Verify branch protection rules allow workflows
